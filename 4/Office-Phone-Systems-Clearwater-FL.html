<p>A normal in-house business PBX system included external and internal phone lines; a computer system server or electronic console that handled call changing and routing; and a console for handbook control. In many cases, physical phones are not even needed for VoIP. The hardware required for an offered VoIP service can vary; some providers need customers to use their particular phone system, while others may be used with any kind of exclusive VoIP phone.</p>
