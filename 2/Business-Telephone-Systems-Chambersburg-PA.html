<p>VoIP phone service has actually been around for a long time as companies and business owners change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a big variety of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephone systems services) for more affordable call rates than conventional telephone systems providers. The hardware and software is affordable, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, cordless "hot spots" in places such as cafes, parks, and airports allow you to link to the Internet and might allow you to use VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
