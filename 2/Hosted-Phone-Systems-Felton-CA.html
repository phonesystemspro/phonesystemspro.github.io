<h3>Virtual PBX Hosted Phone System Felton CA</h3>
<p>Our business telephone systems are sourced from Avaya, Samsung and NEC; 3 of the most trusted and reputable telecoms makers. Instead of subscribing to 100 trunk lines for 100 stations, a PBX delivers numerous stations for only one trunk line. Merely plug the cordless headset telephone into a phones jack, and begin working hands-free nearly anywhere in your home or office.

While Digital Phone Systems are hassle-free and useful; they're not mobile. However, if your business needs to abide by security policies that need data to be kept on-site, then a hosted solution is most likely not the very best service.
