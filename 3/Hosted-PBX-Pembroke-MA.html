<p>Database Systems Corp Nevertheless, today the variety of office phone systems for small company is huge and are based upon different technology platforms. More than a third of companies now utilize VoIP as their go-to system. A hosted system provides all PBX services, applications and functions, and it maintains software in the cloud instead of on a server like digital systems.

VoIP providers use similar-- and normally even more innovative-- features to traditional office phone systems at a much lower price.</p>
